## Overview

`go-ibft` is a simple, straightforward, IBFT state machine implementation.

It doesn't contain fancy synchronization logic, or any kind of transaction execution layer.
Instead, `go-ibft` is designed from the ground up to respect and adhere to the `IBFT 2.0` specification document.

Inside this package, you’ll find that it solves the underlying liveness and persistence issues of the original IBFT
specification, as well as that it contains a plethora of optimizations that make it faster and more lightweight. For a
complete specification overview on the package, you can check out the official documentation.

As mentioned before, `go-ibft` implements basic IBFT 2.0 state machine logic, meaning it doesn’t have any kind of
transaction execution or block building mechanics. That responsibility is left to the `Backend` implementation.

## Installation

To get up and running with the `go-ibft` package, you can pull it into your project using:

`go get github.com/sig-0/go-ibft`

Currently, the minimum required go version is `go 1.19`.

## Usage Examples

```go
package main

import "github.com/sig-0/go-ibft"

// IBFTBackend is the structure that implements all required
// go-ibft Backend interfaces
type IBFTBackend struct {
	// ...
}

// IBFTLogger is the structure that implements all required
// go-ibft Logger interface
type IBFTLogger struct {
	// ...
}

// IBFTTransport is the structure that implements all required
// go-ibft Transport interface
type IBFTTransport struct {
	// ...
}

// ...

func main() {
	backend := NewIBFTBackned(...)
	logger := NewIBFTLogger(...)
	transport := NewIBFTTransport(...)

	ibft := NewIBFT(logger, backend, transport)

	blockHeight := uint64(1)
	ctx, cancelFn := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

	go func() {
		// Run the consensus sequence for the block height.
		// When the method returns, that means that
		// consensus was reached
		i := RunSequence(ctx, blockHeight)
	}

	// ...

	// Stop the sequence by cancelling the context
	cancelFn()
}
```
